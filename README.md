# Initializer

## What is it?
*Initializer* helps you...

## Getting started
1. Clone or download repository.
2. Copy **Initializer** folder from **Plugins** folder to your project.
3. Take a look at the included *Demos*.
4. Done!

Developed in **Unity 2020.3.41f1**, but I don't see why it wouldn't work in any Unity version **as long as Addressables package is supported**.

## How To Use
1. Make sure Addressables package is added to your project.
2. **Right-click** in a folder and navigate to **Create** -> **Initializer** -> **Default Initializer** to create a new Initializer asset.
3. Mark your new Initializer asset as Addressable and set the addressable name as Initializer.
4. The included Default Initializer loads an addressable scene, so create a new scene named "Initialization" and mark it as Addressable.
5. Select your Initializer asset and in the inspector select the scene in the Scene field.
3. Press play!

## Demos
### 1. Basic
A basic example that loads an Initialization scene on application start.
